# Plotfunction for a ICBM-OCEAN Edgelist
Plot networks from edgelists downloaded from ICBM-OCEAN.

Download the function and source it with R or R studio.

The function has the following parameters:

* edgelist # Your edgelist as supplied by ICBM-OCEAN, 
* selected_formula # If supplied a formula inside the edgelist can be coloured (default to NULL, no formula), 
* color_by # the element you want to show a color gradient e.g. "C" 
* cols # the colors you want to use to show the gradient e.g. c("green","red")
* labelsize # the fontsize of your labels e.g. 20
* staticlayout # should the network use physics to center itself
 
Run the function with your downloaded edgelist e.g. 
```
plot_edgelist(edgelist='name of your edgelist',selected_formula = NULL,color_by="H",cols=c("green","purple"),labelsize=40,staticlayout=T)
```

-Have fun creating networks of homologous series!
